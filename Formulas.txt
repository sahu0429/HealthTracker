1. BMI Calculation
Formula:
BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 
2. Weekly and Monthly Summation and Averages
Weekly data updates:

New values are added to a List, and old values are removed if the list exceeds the set limit (7 for weekly data).
For monthly averages, approximate values are calculated by summing weekly totals and multiplying by 4.
Example for Monthly Average (Approximation):

Monthly Average for Steps
=
(
Sum of Weekly Steps
)
×
4
Monthly Average for Steps=(Sum of Weekly Steps)×4
3. Status Calculation Rules
For different health aspects, predefined thresholds are used:

Steps:

Good: steps >= 10,000
Needs Improvement: steps < 10,000
Calories:

Good: calories <= 2,000
High: calories > 2,000
Sleep Hours:

Good: sleepHours >= 7
Needs Improvement: sleepHours < 7
Water Intake:

Good: waterIntake >= 8
Needs Improvement: waterIntake < 8
4. Feedback Rules
For feedback generation:

Steps: Suggest improvement if < 10,000.
Calories: Suggest reduction if > 2,000.
Sleep: Suggest improvement if < 7 hours.
Water Intake: Suggest increasing if < 8 glasses.
5. Stream Summation for Weekly and Monthly Data
Formula for summation of weekly data:
Total Weekly Steps
=
weeklySteps.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum()
Total Weekly Steps=weeklySteps.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum()
Similarly, summation is performed for calories, sleep, and water intake using corresponding streams.
